## Hi, I’m Jessi 👋

I’m passionate about creating games and exploring everything related to game development. I love turning ideas into interactive experiences, whether through gameplay mechanics, storytelling, or visual design.

I’m currently studying Game Development, learning more every day about programming, game design, Unity, and how to build meaningful player experiences.

Here on GitHub, you’ll find my experiments, prototypes, and projects as I continue to grow as a developer. My goal is to keep improving, learn new technologies, and one day create fully polished games.
